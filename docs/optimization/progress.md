# Optimization Construction Progress

## Execution scope

- Plan source: `docs/superpowers/specs/Tavo-Mini-Agent-Optimization-Plan.md` (user-provided; tracked in baseline commit `67063bdb8bc493608fec4c6ae51b6555e78c1d71`)
- Approved scope: Phase 0 and Phase 1 only
- Branch: `codex/data-reliability-optimization`
- Started: 2026-07-15
- Design commit: `bf4bee1 docs: add data reliability phase design`
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-data-reliability-phase-0-1.md`

## Status legend

- `planned`: agreed but not started
- `in progress`: actively being implemented
- `blocked`: requires a decision or external input
- `verified`: implementation and required checks completed

## Phase 0 — Baseline and quality gates

### 0.1 Optimization branch — verified

- Outcome: Created `codex/data-reliability-optimization` from `main`.
- Evidence: branch switch completed on 2026-07-15.
- Risk: The source optimization plan is a user-provided tracked input; its scope remains outside this baseline documentation commit.
- Commit: none required.

### 0.2 Baseline capture — blocked

- Evidence captured: `2026-07-15T17:09:18+08:00` in `docs/optimization/baseline.md`.
- Start state: commit `67063bdb8bc493608fec4c6ae51b6555e78c1d71`; branch `codex/data-reliability-optimization`; initial worktree clean.
- Outcomes: `npm install` and Jest passed (64 suites / 293 tests); `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run apk:debug` failed. TypeScript was deterministically re-verified at `2026-07-15T17:22:43+08:00`: exit `2`, 1,588 diagnostics across 1,641 output lines.
- Blocking commands: `npm run lint`; `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npm run apk:debug`.
- APK evidence: V2.4.3 debug delivery APK was not produced because Ninja hit the Windows 260-character filename limit.

### 0.3 Unified verification commands — planned

- Required evidence: `npm run verify` exit result after scripts are added.

## Phase 1 — Database transaction and migration safety

### 1.1 Safe transaction executor — planned

### 1.2 Transaction-safe migration runner and migration matrix — planned

### 1.3 Initialization order and known-defect repair — planned

### 1.4 Runtime schema manifest and validator — planned

## Phase exit criteria

- `npm run verify` passes for every committed task, or pre-existing failures are explicitly recorded and approved before proceeding.
- `transaction(async` has no matches in `src`, `android`, or `__tests__`.
- `npm run apk:debug` completes after Phase 1.
- Each independent task has a focused conventional commit and a corresponding progress entry.
