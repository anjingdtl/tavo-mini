# Changelog

All notable changes to ShineWriter are documented here. This file follows the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Version
numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added GitHub Actions quality gates for lint, TypeScript, Jest, coverage, Android Debug, and migration tests.
- Added portable Maestro definitions for the core writing, resource, backup, LLM, and pipeline flows.
- Split the SQLite connection/schema/repository layer and the ChapterEditor into smaller owned modules.
- Added mobile-safe LLM scheduling, queue status UI, low-memory pausing, centralized timeout policy, request timing metrics, and private-LAN HTTP validation.
- Added historical Schema 3–13 migration fixtures and a 12-scenario fault-injection recovery matrix.

### Changed

- The current local verification baseline is 78 Jest suites and 381 tests, with the latest local coverage recorded in `README.md` and `docs/optimization/progress.md`.
- The release process now documents migration, backup/restore, online/local model, TTS, background, signing, and checksum checks in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Fixed

- User cancellation is preserved as `cancelled` and is not reported as a timeout or provider failure.

### Known limitations

- Local Jest quality gates terminate cleanly, but repeated GitHub Actions `Verify` runs still time out during Jest after reporting passing suites; no remote green run is claimed until that behavior is resolved.

### Security

- HTTPS is the default for online LLM requests. HTTP requires an explicit warning-confirmed opt-in and is restricted to private IPv4 LAN ranges.
- API keys remain in Android Keystore and are excluded from portable backups.

### Removed

- No production capability was removed in this unreleased work.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added Android llama.cpp local GGUF generation, import validation, progress reporting, cancellation, and local-model settings.
- Added Schema 14 runtime validation, note-mode compatibility repair, manifest-driven v3 backups, SHA-256 checksums, atomic restore, and external local-model references.
- Added TTS foreground keep-alive, unified notification permission handling, and background pipeline service timing fixes.

### Changed

- Release metadata is generated from `package.json`; Release signing requires explicit external environment variables.
- The database initialization path repairs known legacy defects before final schema validation.

### Fixed

- Fixed the legacy `project_note_config` upgrade path that could omit retrieval columns and make note-mode saving fail.
- Fixed world-book field preservation, background pipeline startup timing, and TTS foreground-service cleanup.

### Security

- Backup payloads do not contain LLM credentials; restoring a configuration clears any stale matching Keychain credential.

### Compatibility and upgrade risk

- Existing Schema 13 databases migrate to Schema 14. The startup repair path also handles databases that reached the current tables without all expected columns.
- Existing local GGUF files remain external assets and must be present or re-imported after restore; API keys must be entered again.

### Local model and API compatibility

- The supported local engine is Android llama.cpp with GGUF models. Online configuration remains OpenAI-compatible.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added chapter-aware note navigation and chunking for the resource library.

### Changed

- Kept the database Schema unchanged from 2.4.1 while improving note retrieval context.

### Fixed

- Improved chapter selection and resource-library behavior for long notes.

### Security

- No new credential or network behavior was introduced in this release.

### Compatibility and upgrade risk

- No database migration is required from 2.4.1. Existing notes remain readable; chapter-aware indexing changes how long note content is presented to retrieval.

### Local model and API compatibility

- Local llama.cpp/GGUF and OpenAI-compatible API contracts remain unchanged.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added stronger local-generation progress, startup, and failure feedback.

### Changed

- Hardened local-model generation controls, JNI concurrency/cancellation behavior, Qwen reasoning handling, and APK version-bundle validation.
- Kept the database Schema unchanged from 2.4.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale JavaScript bundles, cold-start pipeline results, inactive local configuration selection, and several local import/generation hangs.

### Security

- No new credential storage behavior was introduced in this release.

### Compatibility and upgrade risk

- No database migration is required from 2.4.0. Existing GGUF model records are retained; devices should re-test model loading after upgrading because native generation control changed.

### Local model and API compatibility

- GGUF models continue to use Android llama.cpp. OpenAI-compatible online endpoints remain supported.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added the Android llama.cpp engine, JNI bridge, GGUF local-model manager, streaming generation, cancellation, and model lifecycle controls.
- Added TurboModule compatibility and regression coverage for the React Native 0.85 Android architecture.

### Changed

- Database Schema advanced from 12 to 13 for local-model metadata.
- The supported local-model path changed to GGUF + llama.cpp; the previous experimental local runtime was removed from the product path.

### Fixed

- Fixed native model-load/generation serialization, request cancellation races, model import state handling, and core TurboModule registration.

### Security

- Local GGUF inference runs on-device and does not require network access.

### Compatibility and upgrade risk

- Upgrading from 2.3.x runs the Schema 12→13 migration. Legacy local-model records may require re-import when their source file or runtime is no longer available.

### Local model and API compatibility

- Android supports `.gguf` models through llama.cpp. Online APIs remain OpenAI-compatible and are independent of the local engine.
